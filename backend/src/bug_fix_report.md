    =====================
    File Path: C:\Users\USER\Desktop\python.py
    Error Message:   File "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\python.py", line 1     print("Hello World)           ^ SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)

    Error Analysis:
    The provided message is indicating that there's an issue with Python syntax in your python script "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\python.py". Here are some points to consider when diagnosing this problem, along as possible solutions for it using a language called Parsing (also known as Lexical Analysis or Scanning).
 
1) The error is about unterminated string literal in Python: This means that you're trying to print out "Hello World" but your code isn’t properly ending the line with quote marks. In other words, it does not terminate correctly when writing a message on one single or two lines as shown above (line 1).
    The syntax error is caused because Python requires quotes around strings for them来说明 that they're meant to be textual content rather than actual code execution within the program itself. You can fix this by adding closing quote marks at line end where print statement has ended like so: `print("Hello World")` instead of just 'Hellllo Worrrld'.
    Python uses double quotes ('"') for string literals, whereas single (''' or " ") are used only when you want to include a newline character within the quotation. Hence it is crucial that these types should be correctly utilized in order for your code not just execute without errors but also have correct output on console as well and may run smoothly if viewed properly by other developers using this same version of python (if they're interpreting line-by-line).
    Make sure you use double quotes around the strings, unless there is a need to include new lines or escape sequence characters.  You can also put your print statement on multiple rows and still it won’t throw any syntax error by Python as long its string literals are correctly placed with correct quote marks ('Hello World' in this case).
    This will help ensure that the code runs without errors, while providing a clear output message to end users.  It also serves better for debugging purposes if you encounter issues later on since it provides an easy way of identifying where exactly something has gone wrong during runtime instead going 'just fine'.   Python’s syntax error reporting tool can be quite useful when dealing with such cases, allowing the developers (or non-developers) to quickly identify what's causing their code problems and then fix them.


    Suggested Fix:
    The correct Python syntax to display "Hello, world" on your console would be written as follows in python (using triple quotes): 
```python
print("""\
 Hello WOrld! \n Welcome back

    Fixed Code:
    print("Hello World)
# Applied fix: The correct Python syntax to display "Hello, world" on your console would be written as follows in python (using triple quotes): 
```python
print("""\
 Hello WOrld! \n Welcome back

    Validation Result:
    The code has syntax errors as you have only one closing parenthesis for the print function in python (`print("Hello World)`). The correct Python Syntax to display "Hello, world" on your console is ```python  and it should be inside triple quotes like this --> """ Hello WOrld! Welcome back """.
